But how do those shocks translate into changes in beliefs and actions? What makes people suddenly become uncertain? This paper provides an explanation for subjective uncertainty shocks, estimated on real-time GDP data, that fits puzzling features of professional forecasts. The key ingredients are that agents do not know the true model governing the distribution of macroeconomic outcomes, but they believe that distribution to be potentially skewed. When agents estimate higher probabilities of extreme tail events, their uncertainty rises. Our estimates reveal that learning about probabilities of tail events – black swans – explains much of the fluctuations in subjective uncertainty.",,10.1016/j.jet.2024.105905,Online only,Journal of Economic Theory,,0022-0531,1095-7235,222,,,2024-12,2024.0,,2024Q3 (MA),Elsevier,,,Financial economics; Risk,"Orlik, Anna, and Laura Veldkamp (2024).

Nesmith,,,Reserve Bank Operations and Payment Systems,"Risk was first incorporated into monetary aggregation over thirty-five years ago,using a stochastic version of the workhorse money-in-the-utility-function model.Nevertheless, the mathematical foundations of this stochastic model remain shaky.To firm the foundations, this paper employs a slightly richer probability conceptthan standard Borel-measurability, which enables me to prove the existence of awell-behaved solution and to derive stochastic Euler equations. This measurabilityapproach is long-established albeit less common in economics, possibly because the derivation of stochastic Euler equations is new. Importantly, the problem’s economics are not restricted by the approach. Consequently, the results provide firm footing for the growing monetary aggregation under risk literature, which integrates monetary and finance theory. As crypto-currencies and stable coins garner more attention, solidifying the foundations of risky money becomes more critical. The method also supports deriving stochastic Euler equations for any dynamic economics problem that features contemporaneous uncertainty about prices, including asset pricing models like CAPM and stochastic consumer choice models.",,10.17016/FEDS.2024.090,Online only,Finance and Economics Discussion Series,,1936-2854,2767-3898,,2024-090,36 p.,2024-11-26,2024.0,,,Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.S.),Money; Risk; Monetary aggregation; Asset pricing; Dynamic programming; Stochastic modeling; Uncertainty; Euler equations,C61; C62; D81; D84; E40; G12,Econometrics and economic theory; Monetary economics,"Nesmith, Travis D.

Using a novel dataset linking mortgage loans, consumer credit profiles, and property sales, we examine the effects of rate hikes on household mobility and the broader economic impacts of the resulting mortgage rate lock-in. As market rates rise relative to those on borrowers’ existing loans, likelihood of moving falls with the highest elasticity among borrowers just “in the money.” Our results suggest about 44% of the decline in moves among mortgage holders between 2021 and 2022 may be attributable to the widening gap between borrower’s existing and market rates. We find limited scope for labor misallocation due to lock-in, as moves across labor market areas are rather unaffected. Instead, lock-in primarily reduces within-metro churn and moves up the housing ladder, leading to fewer real estate listings and greater house price growth. We explain lock-in-driven price increases through a housing search model: in a seller’s market, reduced churn raises market tightness, driving up prices. Consistentwith such a model, we show measures of market tightness increase in response to lock-in, with the most significant effects in markets that were already tight.",,10.17016/FEDS.2024.088,Online only,Finance and Economics Discussion Series,,1936-2854,2767-3898,,2024-088,59 p.,2024-11-20,2024.0,,,Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.S.),Mortgages and credit; Mobility; Housing demand; Rate lock; Housing supply,G21; G51; R21; R31,Consumer economics; Real estate and regional economics; Residential real estate,"Aladangady, Aditya, Jacob Krimmel, and Tess Scharlemann (2024).

We show, however, that when we account for the common trade exposure of a country pair to similar foreign cycles, the effect of bilateral trade on comovement falls sharply. Furthermore, common trade exposure is also a robust predictor of comovement. We conclude that trade is indeed a driver of business-cycle transmission, but often through common exposure to foreign cycles rather than just bilateral linkages. Finally, we consider the implications of these empirical results for the “trade-comovement puzzle.”",,10.1016/j.jinteco.2024.103998,Online only,Journal of International Economics,,0022-1996,1873-0353,152,,,2024-11,2024.0,,2024Q4 (IF),Elsevier,Trade; Business cycles; Open economy macroeconomics,F10; E32; F41; F44,International economics; Macroeconomic activity; Business fluctuations,"Avila-Montealegre, Oscar, and Carter Mix (2024).

The decompositions are based upon PSID data and Altonji, Giraldo-Páez, Hynsjö, and Vidangos’ (2024) statistical model of earnings, marriage, marital sorting, fertility, and nonlabor income. We find that education and employment heterogeneity are key sources of the rise in the variance with age and across birth cohorts. Hours shocks have grown in importance for women, and employment shocks have grown in importance, especially for men after age 30. The variance contribution of wage heterogeneity is substantial at all ages and has risen across cohorts for women.

We model a population of investors who decide to stake, reaping staking rewards, or exit, liquidating their crypto-asset holdings. Runs on staking are more common for weak protocols, when price impacts of protocol failure are high, or when rewards to staking are low. We extend the model to leveraged staking, where margin calls exacerbate run dynamics. In examining staking lock-up periods, we fnd that a longer lock-up period can reduce runs but does not eliminate them. Previous work demonstrates that consensus and security of a crypto-asset depend on low staking rewards, but our results highlight that low rewards induce runs. If a run were to occur on a major Proof-of-Stake backed blockchain, such as Ethereum, this would undermine security, potentially disrupting crypto markets dependent on that blockchain and the Decentralized Finance networks that depend on it.",,,Online only,OFR working paper,,,,,24-08,47 p.,2024-10-31,2024.0,,,Office of Financial Research (Treasury),,,,,,,9212.0,,,,,,m1sjh05,,http://taxonomy.frb.gov/rl/person/i4648; http://taxonomy.frb.gov/rl/person/i5397; http://taxonomy.frb.gov/rl/person/i5398,http://taxonomy.frb.gov/rl/organization/o513,http://taxonomy.frb.gov/rl/publication/p818,,12614

Using data for 24 central banks, we test how communication strategies and their effectiveness depend on the powers assigned to these institutions. We find robust evidence that communications by central banks represented in interagency financial stability committees with more powers are more effective in mitigating a deterioration in financial conditions. These central banks also use macroprudential tools more consistently with their communications and, after conditions deteriorate, transmit a calmer message, suggesting that the ability to use macroprudential tools strengthens incentives not to just “cry wolf.”",,,Print,International Journal of Central Banking,,1815-4654,1815-7556,20,4,pp. 175-220,2024-10,2024.0,,2024Q4 (IF),Association of the International Journal of Central Banking,,G15; G28,Monetary policy; Financial economics; Financial stability; Monetary policy communication,"Londono, Juan M., Stijn Claessens, and Ricardo Correa (2024).

I use Portuguese administrative data from 2009 to 2019 and exploit public contests as a source of quasi-exogenous variation in the award of procurement contracts. Winning one additional euro from a procurement contract increases firm credit by 7 cents at lower interest rates. This finding highlights a mechanism through which future fiscal stimulus can impact the real economy today: procurement contracts increase firms’ net worth by increasing future cash flows that can be used as collateral to ease borrowing constraints and boost corporate liquidity. Consequently, this enhanced access to credit promotes higher investment and employment, with these effects being more pronounced and persistent in smaller and financially constrained firms.

An Exploration of the Manufacturing Wage Premium,"Bayard, Kimberly; Cajner, Tomaz; Gregorich, Vivi; Tito, Maria D.",Kimberly Bayard; Tomaz Cajner; Vivi Gregorich; Maria D. Tito,,,Research and Statistics,"This paper explores the factors behind differences in wages between manufacturing and other sectors. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we find that the manufacturing wage premium--the additional pay a manufacturing worker earns relative to a comparable nonmanufacturing worker--disappeared in recent years and that the erosion of the premium has primarily affected workers employed in production occupations, who experienced a wage decline of 2.5 percentage points since the 1990s relative to other workers in production occupations. While the demographic composition and other worker observables introduce level differences in manufacturing premia, our analysis suggests that they are not responsible for the declining trends. A decomposition of the premium by union membership status reveals that declines have been substantially larger across union members. To quantify the role of unionization membership on wage premia, we exploit the heterogeneity in membership status across industries within manufacturing. We find that the decline in union membership explains more than 70 percent of the decline in premia since the 1990s for union members, but the declines in unionization rates have not significantly affected non-union premia, which have instead responded to other factors, such as capital intensity. Our findings suggest that the erosion of ""good"" manufacturing jobs has contributed to the increase in overall wage inequality and could accelerate the decline of the manufacturing sector.",,10.17016/FEDS.2022.011r1,Revision,Finance and Economics Discussion Series,,1936-2854,2767-3898,,2022-011r1,53 p.,2024-09-24,2024.0,2022-03,,Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.S.),Wage Inequality; Wage Premia; Manufacturing; Production Workers; Union Membership,E24; J31; J51,Labor economics; Manufacturing,"Bayard, Kimberly, Tomaz Cajner, Vivi Gregorich, and Maria D.

We show that the same marginal relationship can be described rigorously for any machine learning model by calculating the slope of the partial dependence functions, which we call the partial marginal effect (PME). We prove that the PME of OLS is analytically equivalent to the OLS regression coefficient. Bootstrapping provides standard errors and confidence intervals around the point estimates of the PMEs. We apply the PME to a hedonic house pricing example and demonstrate that the PMEs of neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, and gradient boosting models reveal the non-linear relationships discovered by the machine learning models and allow direct comparison between those models and a traditional linear regression.

Bora Durdu; Sergio Villalvazo,,,Financial Stability,"This paper investigates the impact of loan-to-value (LtV) borrowing constraints in models with occasionally binding credit constraints. These constraints give rise to a Fisherian debt-deflation mechanism, where exogenous shocks can trigger cascading effects resulting in significant declines in consumption, asset prices, and borrowing reversals—characteristic of financial crises. However, recent literature challenges traditional view by suggesting that collateral constraints may not always exacerbate financial disturbances but could instead foster dynamics leading to multiple equilibria. Building on this discussion, the paper explores equilibrium asset pricing models with LtV collateral constraints, identifying critical thresholds that govern asset price dynamics, consumption patterns, and current account behaviors. Our analysis uncovers that when the LtV limit is close to zero, tighter constraints induce smaller drops in consumption during crises. Conversely, when the LtV limit is close to one, we observe that tighter constraints induce larger drops in consumption during crises. The nonlinear relationship between the LtV ratio and adverse effects on macroeconomic outcomes aligns with cross-country evidence regarding the relationship between the level of financial development and the severity of consumption declines during crises.",,10.17016/FEDS.2024.081,Online only,Finance and Economics Discussion Series,,1936-2854,2767-3898,,2024-081,23 p.,2024-09-20,2024.0,,,Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.S.),Financial crises; Loan-to-value constraints; Debt-deflation,E31; E37; E52; F41; G01,Macroeconomic activity; Economic modeling; Loans,"Durdu, C.

This paper contributes with a software—a graphical user interface that allows practitioners to perform BCA exercises with minimal effort—and exemplifies the procedure by studying the U.S. recessions in 1973 and 1990 and reflecting upon the critiques BCA has been subject to. We look into the many equivalence theorems that the literature has produced and that allow BCA practitioners to identify the theories that are quantitatively relevant for the economic period under study. The methodological extensions that have been brought forth since BCA's original inception are addressed as well as conclusions regarding the relative contribution of each wedge: GDP and investment are usually driven by an efficiency wedge, hours worked are closely related to the labor wedge and, in an open economy extension, the investment wedge helps to explain country risk spreads on international bonds. Finally, larger changes in interest rates and currency crises are usually associated with the investment and/or the labor wedge.",,10.1111/joes.12581,Print,Journal of Economic Surveys,,,0950-0804,38,4,pp. 1276-1316,2024-09,2024.0,,2024Q3 (MA); 2023Q3 (MA),Wiley-Blackwell,Business cycle accounting; Business cycles; Wedges,E27; E30; E32; E37,Macroeconomic activity; Business fluctuations,"Brinca, Pedro, João Ricardo Costa Filho, and Francesca Loria (2024).

We find that DVP and UVP predict international stock returns through U.S. bad and good macroeconomic uncertainties, respectively. Sixty percent to 80% of the dynamics of the global equity risk premium for horizons under seven months are driven by economic uncertainty, whereas risk aversion appears more relevant for longer horizons. The predictability patterns of DVP and UVP vary across countries depending on those countries’ financial and economic exposure to global shocks.

Smith; Allan Timmermann; Jonathan H. Wright,,,Research and Statistics,"We investigate the effect of uncertainty surrounding the slope of the Phillips curve on optimal monetary policy. To do this, we first account for parameter uncertainty in a time-invariant Bayesian Phillips curve model. Second, we generalize this model to allow for instabilities in the form of breaks. In both the United States (US) and the European Union (EU), we identify a break around the turn of the century, after which the Phillips curve flattened. Finally, we show how breaks amplify uncertainty in the Phillips curve model, significantly impacting optimal monetary policy. Accounting for breaks causes policymakers to respond more cautiously to deviations in the unemployment rate from its natural rate – as they are less certain about the impact of economic slack on inflation – but to compensate for this increased caution by responding more aggressively to deviations of inflation from its target. Our estimates provide a lower bound for the magnitude of the impact of breaks on the change in responsiveness of optimal monetary policy since they are based on the full sample of data, while policymakers face additional uncertainty as they must continuously determine in real time whether a break has occurred.",,10.17016/2380-7172.3603,Online only,FEDS Notes,,,2380-7172,,2024-08-30-1,,2024-08-30,2024.0,,,Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.S.),,,Econometrics and economic theory; Monetary policy,"Smith, Simon C., Allan Timmermann, and Jonathan H.

We use confidential loan-level data on bank CRE portfolios to examine banks' exposure to at-risk CRE loans. We investigate (1) what loan characteristics are associated with delinquency and (2) to what extent the portfolio composition of major CRE lenders determines their exposure to losses. Higher LTVs, larger property sizes, and greater local remote work tendencies are all associated with increased delinquency risk, particularly for office loans. We use several machine learning algorithms to demonstrate that variation in exposure to these risk factors can account for most of the performance disparity across different types of CRE lenders.

Inframarginal borrowers---households whose choice to buy a home or refinance does not depend on the particular monetary policy decision under consideration---are the most important conduit, explaining over half of the pass-through. Consistently large flows of inframarginal borrowing relative to the stock of outstanding debt account for the strength of this channel. Households with adjustable-rate mortgages and marginal refinancers, the focus of much of the literature on monetary policy's effect on mortgage borrowers, each explain about 20 percent of the pass-through.

Banks increased lending to the agricultural sector in counties with higher insurance coverage after 1980, even when affected by adverse weather shocks. Further, while they increased risky lending, they were sufficiently compensated by insurance such that their overall risk did not increase meaningfully.

Using 85 million observations on U.S. auto loans, we study households’ credit risk by engine type, seek to uncover the sources and ask if credit risk differentials are being priced. We find that EV borrowers default 29% less relative to internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) borrowers with a back-of-the-envelope value of $1,457 in lender savings. To disentangle selection from expost exposure to differential costs of running an EV, we implement a differential shock exposure by treatment model of Borusyak and Hull (2023). Do lenders passalong these savings to borrowers? EV borrowers pay 2.2 percentage point lower interest rate, the equivalent of $2,711 in foregone payments. This lower rate is only for captive (manufacturer-based) lenders, not for bank and nonbank lenders, suggestive of policy and strategic motives by manufacturers, not a passing along of credit risk value. Another $1,457 is probably not being priced to households.

When incorporated in a DSGE term structure model with a standard productivity shock, this demand shock generates term premia that are on average higher, with sizable countercyclical variation that arises endogenously. The model helps reconcile the empirical evidence that term premia have been on average positive and countercyclical, with numerous studies pointing to demand shocks as a key driver of business cycles over the last few decades.",,10.17016/FEDS.2022.086r1,Revision,Finance and Economics Discussion Series,,1936-2854,2767-3898,,2022-086r1,61 p.,2024-08-13,2024.0,2022-12,2024Q3 (MA),Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.S.),Yield Curve; Term Premium; Term Structure of Interest Rates; DSGE Model; Imperfect Information; Learning,D83; E12; E43; E44; E52; G12,Econometrics and economic theory; Macroeconomic activity; Yield curve; Information economics,"Tanaka, Hiroatsu (2024).

In this setting, contrary to standard New Keynesian (NK) models, we show that ""an inflation scares problem"" for the central bank can arise where agents' longer-run inflation expectations deviate persistently from a central bank's inflation target. We formally characterize optimal time-consistent monetary policy when there is uncertainty about the planning horizons of private sector agents and a risk of inflation scares.

Our findings shed empirical light on the interplay of frictions influencing banks’ provision of dollar funding.",,10.17016/FEDS.2024.061,Online only,Finance and Economics Discussion Series,,1936-2854,2767-3898,,2024-061,93 p.,2024-08-02,2024.0,,2024Q3 (FS),Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.S.),Basis; Covered-interest parity deviation; Foreign exchange; Safe assets,F30; F31; F65; G10; G13; G15; G20; G23,International economics; Financial economics; Foreign exchange (FX) markets,"Moskowitz, Tobias J., Chase P.

We exploit a quasi‐natural experiment in the form of a trade reform in Colombia to study how firms with differential exposure to reductions in capital goods tariffs react in terms of their investment and labour decision. Firms that see a larger decline in the input tariff for capital goods increase investment and labour for production, as well as their labour share.

The position advanced in these 2000-2009 papers was that, instead, UK economic policy until 1979 subscribed to a nonmonetary perspective on inflation. This perspective implied UK authorities' rejection of Phillips-curve-type trade-off analysis, but it also meant that they misjudged the importance of monetary policy in inflation control, thereby compounding the country's inflation problem. When this series of papers began to appear at the start of the 2000s, the trade-off-centered interpretation of the US Great Inflation was highly prevalent and was also being applied to the UK Great Inflation. By late in the decade, however, the case--as outlined in the 2000-2009 papers--against Phillips-curve-based accounts of historical policy conduct had gained notable acceptance among central bankers and academic researchers who discussed the UK Great Inflation. This article corrects erroneous statements that the challenge to Phillips-curve-based accounts of historical UK policymaker behavior only appeared in research starting in the 2010s.",,10.1215/00182702-11242717,Print,History of Political Economy,,0018-2702,1527-1919,56,4,pp. 713-727,2024-08,2024.0,,2024Q3 (MA),Duke University Press,UK monetary policy; Phillips curve; Great Inflation; Nonmonetary approach to inflation,,Economic policy; Phillips curve,"Nelson, Edward (2024).
